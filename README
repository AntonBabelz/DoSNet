DoSNet is a basic BotNet Master/Slave. 
Its use is strictly for educational purposes.  
It is not resilient in anyway and should be used strictly 
for observing the core concepts of botnet communication.

To use this program, python 2.6+ is required.

This will strictly perform Denial of Service attacks
against web servers on port 80.

To run this ->

Slaves:
Give each file executable permissions
./botSlave.py to run the slave

Master:
Give the master executable permissions

Under the area (array) "addresses", change the values '127.0.0.1', 
to slave addresses (it supports more than 2)

Under target, change the IP to a url (no http://) or a valid IP.

When ready...
./botMaster.py

The clients will receive the request and begin attacking
